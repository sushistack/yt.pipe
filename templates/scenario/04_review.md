## Review Checklist

### 1. SCP Classification Accuracy
- Verify Object Class matches source data exactly
- Verify Containment Class is correct
- Verify any clearance levels mentioned are accurate

### 2. Anomalous Properties Accuracy
- Each stated property must exist in source facts
- No properties should be fabricated or exaggerated
- Severity descriptions must match source tone

### 3. Containment Procedure Correctness
- Stated procedures must match source specifications
- No invented containment measures
- Security protocols must be accurately described

### 4. Visual Identity Consistency
- Every scene where the entity appears must use the Frozen Descriptor
- No physical description should contradict the Visual Identity Profile
- Verify visual descriptions don't add non-canonical features

### 5. Fact Coverage Check
- List each source fact and whether it appears in the narration
- Calculate coverage percentage
- Flag critical facts that are missing

### 6. Storytelling Quality
Evaluate the narration's storytelling effectiveness:
- **Hook strength**: Does Scene 1 open with a clear hook type (question, shock, mystery, or contrast)? Rate 0-100.
- **Information curve**: Are key facts distributed across 3+ scenes using progressive disclosure (not front-loaded)? Rate 0-100.
- **Emotional variation**: Do adjacent scenes have different moods? Count consecutive same-mood pairs (0 is ideal). Rate 0-100.
- **Immersion devices**: Count occurrences of 2nd person address, sensory description, situation hypotheticals (minimum 3 per scenario). Rate 0-100.

Calculate `storytelling_score` as the average of these four sub-scores.

## Task

Output a JSON review report:
```json
{
  "overall_pass": true/false,
  "coverage_pct": 85.0,
  "issues": [
    {
      "scene_num": 3,
      "type": "fact_error|missing_fact|descriptor_violation|invented_content",
      "severity": "critical|warning|info",
      "description": "What is wrong",
      "correction": "Specific text to replace or add"
    }
  ],
  "corrections": [
    {
      "scene_num": 3,
      "field": "narration|visual_description",
      "original": "original text snippet",
      "corrected": "corrected text"
    }
  ],
  "storytelling_score": 75,
  "storytelling_issues": [
    {
      "scene_num": 1,
      "type": "weak_hook|flat_info_curve|monotone_mood|low_immersion",
      "severity": "warning",
      "description": "What is wrong with storytelling",
      "correction": "Suggested improvement"
    }
  ]
}
```

Only report actual issues found. If the script is accurate, return an empty issues array. Storytelling issues are advisory — they do NOT affect `overall_pass`.

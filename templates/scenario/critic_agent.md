## Evaluation Instructions

Answer these questions honestly:
1. **Hook (Scene 1)**: Would a casual YouTube viewer stay past the first 5 seconds? Is the opening line a genuine hook (Question/Shock/Mystery/Contrast)?
2. **Retention**: Would a viewer watch past 1 minute? Is information revealed progressively or front-loaded?
3. **Emotional Curve**: Do moods vary between scenes? Or is it monotone throughout?
4. **Immersion**: Does the narration pull the viewer IN (2nd person, sensory details, hypotheticals)?
5. **Ending**: Would a viewer like/subscribe after watching? Does it leave lingering impact?

## Output Format (JSON only, no markdown fences)

{
  "verdict": "pass" | "retry" | "accept_with_notes",
  "hook_effective": true/false,
  "retention_risk": "low" | "medium" | "high",
  "ending_impact": "strong" | "medium" | "weak",
  "feedback": "Concrete, actionable improvement instructions in Korean. Be specific about which scenes need what changes.",
  "scene_notes": [
    {"scene_num": 1, "issue": "description of problem", "suggestion": "specific fix"}
  ]
}

Rules:
- "pass": Scenario is production-ready. Would get >50% watch-through rate. Narration sounds like a real YouTuber, not a wiki reader.
- "retry": Significant issues that require rewriting. Be specific in feedback.
- "accept_with_notes": Passable but not great. Note improvements for future reference.
- feedback MUST be in Korean and MUST be specific ("Scene 1을 Shock Hook으로 교체: 'SCP-173은 14명의 재단 인원을 살해했습니다'")
- Do NOT be generous. If it's mediocre, say "retry".
- If the narration sounds like a Wikipedia article or government report, ALWAYS say "retry". YouTube viewers leave in 5 seconds if the tone is boring.
